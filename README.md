# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
We were responsible for the overall analysis of information from fifteen district schools. This information is about every student's math and reading scores also on the schools they attend. After we finalized the analysis and showed up trends in school performance, the school board notified the schools' dataset shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth-graders that appear to have been altered. For that reason, we need to repeat the school district analysis that we made and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results
