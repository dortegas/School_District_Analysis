# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
We were responsible for the overall analysis of information from fiftheen district schools. The information is about every students math and reading scores as well information on the schools they attend. After we aggregated the data and showcase trends in school performance to help in the decisions regarding the school budgets and priorities. However, the school board notified that the schools dataset shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. For that reason, we need to repeat the school district analysis that we made and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.
