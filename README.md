# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
We were responsible for the overall analysis of information from fifteen district schools. This information is about every student's math and reading scores also on the schools they attend. After we finalized the analysis and showed up trends in school performance, the school board notified the schools' dataset shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth-graders that appear to have been altered. For that reason, we need to repeat the school district analysis that we made and write up a report to describe how these changes affected the overall analysis.

## Results

  - How is the district summary affected?

    The differences between the results of the school district summary show that the percentage of the overall passing decreases a decimal when we omit the Thomas High School's   ninth graders on the analysis, as the images below show. The difference between the average math score is only a decimal too. 
    
  - How is the school summary affected?

    In the school summary, Thomas High School remains in second place in the top five performing schools, so the school is not affected on the percentage passing math and reading, and the overall passing. As the images below show.
    
- How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
  
  As I mentioned before, Thomas High School remained in second place in the top five performing schools. The passing math percentage decreased ten decimal points and the passing reading percentage three decimal points, which results, the overall passing decreased approximately three decimal points.
